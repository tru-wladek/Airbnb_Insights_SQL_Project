# üè° Airbnb Mallorca Data Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project

# Introduction

Having traveled to Mallorca multiple times and actively used Airbnb for renting properties, I became curious about the trends shaping the island‚Äôs short-term rental market. This curiosity led me to analyze Airbnb data, uncover pricing strategies, and extract valuable insights for both hosts and property managers.

For this project, I used the latest dataset from Inside Airbnb, which includes over 16,000 listings across Mallorca. While the raw dataset contained numerous columns, I focused on the most impactful factors influencing pricing and demand.

# The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were 

1.  üèôÔ∏è **What hosts has the most listings and in which neighbourhood?**
    
2.  üè° **What property types generate the highest revenue?** (Approximately due to lack of revenue dataüòâ)
    
3.  üìç **What is the most common property type in each neighborhood?**
    
4.  üí∞ **Which listings are underpriced compared to the neighborhood average?**
    
5.  üßº **If I wanted to sell cleaning services, how would I identify hosts struggling with cleanliness issues?**
    

By answering these questions, I was able to **highlight pricing trends, demand patterns, and business opportunities** for hosts and service providers.

# Tools Used

For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, I used:

*   **SQL** ‚Äì The core tool for querying, cleaning, and analyzing Airbnb data.
    
*   **Azure Data Studio** ‚Äì A powerful database management system, ideal for handling large Airbnb datasets.
    
*   **Excel** ‚Äì Used for initial **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and minor cleaning before deeper analysis.
    
*   **Tableau** ‚Äì Created an interactive visualization to map listings and identify key insights.
    

# Cleaning the Data üõ†Ô∏è

After an initial EDA, I quickly noticed significant inconsistencies in the **price** column:

*   **Missing Values**: About **1,000 listings** had no price data.
    
*   **Extreme Outliers**: Several hosts listed properties at **‚Ç¨9,999 per night**, which is unrealistic‚Äîeven for luxury properties. ¬†**Skewed Data** like this could distort insights, especially when using aggregate functions like AVG() or SUM().
    

üîç **Identifying and Handling Outliers with IQR**

To detect outliers, I used the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method, which flags values that are significantly lower or higher than most of the data. Here's how it works:

1.  **Find the quartiles** (Q1 = 25th percentile, Q3 = 75th percentile).
    
2.  **Calculate IQR** (Interquartile Range): IQR = Q3 - Q1.
    
3.  **Define Outlier Boundaries**:
    
    *   Any value **below** Q1 - 2 \* IQR is too low.
        
    *   Any value **above** Q3 + 2 \* IQR is too high.
        

üí° **SQL Solution**: I first calculated Q1 & Q3, stored them in a temporary table, and then replaced extreme values with NULL.

üìå **Filling in Missing Prices**

Now that outliers were removed, I needed to replace all NULL values with **more reasonable estimates**. Instead of filling them randomly, I took the **average price of properties in the same neighborhood**.

‚úÖ **Final Result**

*   **Before:** Prices ranged from **‚Ç¨8** to an unrealistic **‚Ç¨9,999**.
    
*   **After:** Normalized prices range from **‚Ç¨8 to ‚Ç¨650**, providing a much cleaner dataset for analysis.
    

|price\_range|count\_before|count\_after|
|---|---|---|
|null|939|-|
|0-999|15168|16862|
|1000-1999|445|-|
|2000-2999|66|-|
|3000-3999|29|-|
|4000-4999|3|-|

# üìä Analyzing the Cleansed Data

After cleaning the dataset, I focused on answering key business questions that provide valuable insights for Airbnb hosts, investors, and even service providers. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my approach and findings:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Which Hosts Have the Most Listings, and Where Are They Located?

This query identifies the **largest Airbnb operators** by counting the number of properties each host manages. Additionally, it determines **which neighborhood** each host has the most listings in.

üìå **Findings:**

*   The **top 10 hosts** each manage **over 100 properties**.
    
*   **Homerti** is the **largest** operator, with **803 properties**!
    
*   The **most popular areas for large-scale hosts** are **Pollen√ßa and Alc√∫dia**, indicating these neighborhoods attract major property managers.
    

|host\_id|host\_name|total\_listings|most\_listings\_neighbourhood|
|---|---|---|---|
|80839530|Homerti|803|Alc√∫dia|
|97222654|Best Holiday Homes Limited|239|Pollen√ßa|
|205496849|Holidu|238|Pollen√ßa|
|65697804|Ideal Property Mallorca|228|Alc√∫dia|

|122491844|Sealand Villas|178|Pollen√ßa|
|156144596|Mallorca Villa Selection|171|Alc√∫dia|
|285670200|Holidu|169|Pollen√ßa|
|80636743|Foravila|143|Santa Margalida|
|76875955|Team FiveStarsHome|142|Pollen√ßa|

Table representing hosts with most listings and their key locations

Additionally, I created a **Tableau visualization** to analyze property price intensity across Mallorca and uncover **geographical insights**. The data reveals that while **bookings are concentrated along the south coast**, the **highest prices** are found in the **Pollenca area in the north**. This suggests **high competition** in luxury rentals there, making it challenging for new entrants to compete with **experienced professionals**.

The **density map represents** the distribution of property prices across Mallorca

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Which Property Types Generate the Highest Revenue?**

Since Airbnb doesn‚Äôt provide direct revenue data nor the booking data so I estimated **annual revenue** based on:¬†**(Price per night) √ó (365 - Available dates)**assuming unavailable dates = booked nights

üìå **Findings:**

*   The most profitable property types are **luxury stays** such as **private lodges, entire villas, and cottages**, generating **‚Ç¨38K ‚Äì ‚Ç¨80K annually**.
    
*   Additionally, **hotel rooms** earn around **‚Ç¨35K per year**, showing that even simpler accommodations can be lucrative.
    

|property\_type|avg\_revenue|
|---|---|
|Private room in nature lodge|79935|
|Tower|57768|
|Private room in serviced apartment|52802|
|Private room in cottage|49540|
|Entire cottage|46032|
|Entire villa|45138|
|Room in heritage hotel|42471|
|Entire chalet|41809|
|Room in serviced apartment|40464|
|Room in bed and breakfast|38139|
|Room in hotel|34184|
|Earthen home|33436|
|Entire home|33427|

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is the Most Common Property Type in Each Neighborhood?

This query determines the **dominant property type** in different areas of Mallorca.

üìå **Findings:**

*   **Pollen√ßa** has the most **entire villas (1,466 properties)**, making it the island‚Äôs top location for villa rentals.
    
*   The rest of the island follows a similar trend, with **entire homes and villas dominating most neighborhoods**.
    
|neighbourhood\_cleansed|property\_type|property\_count|
|---|---|---|
|Pollen√ßa|Entire villa|1466|
|Palma de Mallorca|Entire rental unit|545|
|Alc√∫dia|Entire rental unit|458|
|Santany√≠|Entire villa|302|
|Manacor|Entire home|287|
|Santa Margalida|Entire home|250|
|Llucmajor|Entire home|223|
|Campos|Entire home|203|
|Capdepera|Entire rental unit|195|
|Felanitx|Entire villa|192|
|S√≥ller|Entire home|167|
|Art√†|Entire home|165|
|Calvi√†|Entire rental unit|159|
|Muro|Entire home|151|
|Sa Pobla|Entire villa|128|

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Which Listings Are Underpriced Compared to the Neighborhood Average?

I defined **"underpriced" listings** as properties listed **50% below** the average price in their neighborhood. This helps potential investors find **hidden gems** and allows hosts to adjust pricing strategies.

üìå **Findings:**

*   **Palma de Mallorca** has the highest number of underpriced listings (**~500 properties**).
    
*   **Pollen√ßa and Alc√∫dia** follow with **~300 underpriced properties** each.
    

This suggests that while these areas are popular, **some hosts may be pricing their listings too low**, potentially missing out on higher profits.

|neighbourhood\_cleansed|underpriced\_listings|
|---|---|
|Palma de Mallorca|406|
|Pollen√ßa|291|
|Alc√∫dia|276|
|Santany√≠|151|
|Llucmajor|123|
|Felanitx|118|
|Manacor|117|
|Capdepera|115|
|Calvi√†|109|
|Santa Margalida|106|

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ How Can I Identify Hosts Struggling with Cleanliness Issues?

To **sell cleaning services**, I needed to find hosts with **recurring cleanliness complaints**. The approach:
‚úÖ Joined Airbnb reviews with listings 
‚úÖ Filtered for keywords like "dirty" in **multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian).
‚úÖ Ranked hosts by the number of negative comments

üìå **Findings:**

*   **Homerti**, the largest host, has **87 affected listings** and **105 total complaints**.
    
*   However, **some small hosts have major cleaning issues**, e.g.:
    
    *   **Xesca** (2 listings) ‚Üí **67 negative cleaning reviews**
        
    *   **Biel** (1 listing) ‚Üí **40 negative cleaning reviews**
        

These hosts could **benefit from professional cleaning services**, making them potential **business opportunities**.

|host\_id|host\_name|total\_dirty\_comments|affected\_listings|
|---|---|---|---|
|80839530|Homerti|105|87|
|6040504|Xesca|67|2|
|122491844|Sealand Villas|51|42|
